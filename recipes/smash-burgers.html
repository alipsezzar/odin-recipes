    <h1>Homemade Smash Burgers</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This smash burger reipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.
        Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results,
        and make sure the meat is very cold. i prefer to cook these
        outdoors to avoid smoking up kitchen these grill up very fast because of
        the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
       <li>1 pound ground chuck beed (80% lean)</li>
       <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
       <li>salt to taste</li>
       <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
       <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoot grill for high heat and lighly
            oil the grate. set a cast iron flat-top griddle or 
            large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking
        </li>
        <li>
            spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top 
            until lightly browned. Set aside
        </li>
        <li>
            From meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not
            pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.
            Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment
            (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on 
            a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness 
            using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas as you press down. You may also use the
            bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown
            and the centers are light pink color. Using a bench scraper 
            or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and
            immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional
            15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-coveredpatties so you
            so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite
            toppings.
